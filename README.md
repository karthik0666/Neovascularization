Description :
Millions of people suffer from diabetic retinopathy, the leading cause of blindness among working aged adults. Aravind Eye Hospital in India hopes to detect and prevent this disease among people living in rural areas where medical screening is difficult to conduct.
I am going to build a machine learning model to speed up disease detection.I have to work with thousands of images collected in rural areas to help identify diabetic retinopathy automatically.

Data Description :
Large set of retina images taken using fundus photography under a variety of imaging conditions. A clinician has rated each image for the severity of diabetic retinopathy on a scale of 0 to 4:

0 - No DR
1 - Mild
2 - Moderate
3 - Severe
4 - Proliferative DR
